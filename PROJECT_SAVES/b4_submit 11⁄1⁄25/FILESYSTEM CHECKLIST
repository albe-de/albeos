File System Implementation Checklist

5. User Interface Integration
alsh.c (Command Recognition)

    parse_command: Updates to recognize file system commands (e.g., create, read, write, delete, list).
    handle_create_command: Calls create_file and handles user input.
    handle_read_command: Calls read_file and handles user input.
    handle_write_command: Calls write_file and handles user input.
    handle_delete_command: Calls delete_file and handles user input.
    handle_list_command: Calls list_directory and displays the results.

6. Linker Script Changes
linker.ld

    Define Sections: Update to define sections for the file system structures (e.g., superblock, inodes, data blocks).
    Memory Layout: Ensure the memory layout accommodates the file system structures.

7. Build Script Changes
build.sh

    Include File System Source Files: Update to include filesystem.c and disk.c in the compilation process.
    Linker Script Reference: Ensure the build script references the updated linker script.

8. Testing and Debugging
test_filesystem.c

    test_create_file: Tests the create_file function.
    test_read_file: Tests the read_file function.
    test_write_file: Tests the write_file function.
    test_delete_file: Tests the delete_file function.
    test_list_directory: Tests the list_directory function.

9. Documentation
README.md

    Code Comments: Add comments to your code explaining the purpose of each function and structure.
    User Documentation: Create documentation for users on how to use the file system commands.

10. Future Enhancements

    File Permissions: Consider implementing file permissions and access control.
    Directory Support: Implement support for nested directories and path navigation.
    File Metadata: Consider adding support for file metadata (creation date, modification date).

This checklist provides a structured approach to implementing a file system in your operating system, detailing specific files and functions along with their purposes. Each item can be expanded into specific tasks as you progress through the development process.
